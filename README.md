# What is this?

This is a very silly and simple test that basically loads this site
http://html5demos.com/drag where you will be able to verify if drag and drop
works inside an Electron window.

# Try it!

Clone the repo and then type:

    $ npm install
    $ npm start

Then, do what the window tells you to do.
